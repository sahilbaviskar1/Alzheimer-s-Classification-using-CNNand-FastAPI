# Alzheimer's Classification using CNN and FastAPI

This project aims to classify Alzheimer's disease using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and FastAPI for real-time deployment. The model takes brain scan images and predicts whether the individual has Alzheimer's disease.

## Project Overview

This project uses deep learning techniques to classify Alzheimer's disease. The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze brain scan images, such as MRI scans, and determine the likelihood of the presence of Alzheimer's disease. The FastAPI framework is used to deploy the model as a web service for real-time predictions.

### Key Features:
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):** CNNs are used to extract features from brain images and classify them as either Alzheimer's or non-Alzheimer's.
- **FastAPI:** A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python. It serves the trained model and allows real-time predictions through HTTP requests.
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** The CNN model is built and trained using TensorFlow and Keras.
